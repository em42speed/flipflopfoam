            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The Springer Perilous is currently the highest powered 3D printed springer foam blaster on the market as designed; while other blasters can reach where the Springer Perilous does, they require serious custom work to do so. 
                </p>
                <p>I needed a blaster to outshoot and outrange everyone else in the local uncapped club; I found that when asking around the Nerf internet community, nobody had any reasonable recommendations for a build that could reach 350+ FPS. I kept being told my options were things like a Worker Swift or Dart Zone Mk4, which were prone to breaking, a K14 Caliburn, which are brutal to prime, or a Sabre full metal blaster, which start at approximately $500. I set out to design something that would hit the numbers I needed.
                </p>
                <p>My first attempt at such a design was the PumpPoon (a combination of Sillybutts' Pump Skewer and Harpoon versions of Taffy's original Skewer), which I found to be effective but fragile. I set out to get the most draw I could out of common 11" springs, in a heavily overbuilt platform. Additionally, I kept hearing the Sabre Apex Prime being talked up; I decided to incorporate a linear rail, to achieve the smooth prime Sabre blasters are reputedly capable of.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, the Springer Perilous. The side-mounted magwell allows a shorter reach to the pump grip; the rear cap allows for changing the spring and plunger to fit different FPS goals. The linear rail in the front end is wider than most used in the hobby, and gives an extremely smooth prime, especially coupled with the 185mm draw. The accessory rail on the top is angled 2 degrees, so you don't have to bottom out elevation on a mounted optic. 
                </p>
                <p>This is, without exaggeration, the best long range foam blaster platform I've ever seen. I field my own Springer Perilous at uncapped games regularly; I often make hits at 200+ feet and have compared it directly in game to Sabre products. It is both lighter and more ergonomic than the Sabre Apex Prime (it's also way nicer to use, don't buy an Apex- two linear rails being used structurally absolutely sucks. QC doesn't exist... honestly, I could write an essay on why the Apex sucks), it's easier to prime than an Apex, a K14 Caliburn, a Baize, anything else over 300 around here- tested with a force gauge- and with the angled rail, much easier to land shots on target with than any of those. 
                </p>
                <p>Because I know y'all love numbers- tested up to 482 fps, without being fully optimized. I use it typically around 360,  430 if there are higher powered blasters on the field.
                </p>
